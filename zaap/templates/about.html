                 The foundation of secretsrecipes was led by  <strong> Pooja Rajak </strong>  A girl with dreamy eyes and vision. Pooja inclines Taste and recipes which turned into Hobby. She then moved towards making tastes and started delivering foods to their friends. Later She tested his hand in the Computer Science Engineering but couldnâ€™t make it. This unfortunate failure gave rise to fortunate beginnings. The idea of Secret recipe strikes him and along with the guidance of her Mom & Dad the nation turned into reality.
